## Overview
Implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to find the global sequence alignment. Finds the most optimal alignment between two given sequences using dynamic programming.


## Compilation
Use the provided Makefile to compile the program:
```
make
```
To remove the compiled executable, run:
```
make clean
```

## Usage
